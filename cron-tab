          The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. 
          Crontab stands for “cron table, ” because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks; cron itself is named after “chronos, ” the 
          Greek word for time. cron is the system process which will automatically perform tasks for you according to a set schedule. 
          The schedule is called the crontab, which is also the name of the program used to edit that schedule. 

         The Linux Crontab Format is represented by the following syntax:
                 MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD
                  min   =  It ranges from 0 to 59 .
                  hour  =  It spans from 0 to 23.
                  dom   =  It ranges from 1 to 31.
                  mon   =  It varies from 1 to 12.
                  dow   =  It is represented by numbers from 0 to 6, where both 0 and 6 correspond to Sunday.
